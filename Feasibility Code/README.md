# Feasibility Code

### Instructions
Please clone the entire repository into your R environment.

You only need to interact with the file CodeToRun.R
Please fill in all the necessary information according to your situation. 

If you encounter any errors or if you have questions, please report them as an issue here in github. 
Other people may have the same questions, and thereby we can answer them for all. 

### Of Note
The package CDM Connector does not support the database management system BIG QUERY, i.e. it will not be possible for you to participate in the MegaStudy. 
It does support SQLServer, postgresql, redshift, snowflake, oracle, and spark. 
If you have another database management system we will find out how it goes. Please report this as an issue in github.

## Issues

If you encounter problems or have questions please open an issue here in github.

## Returning results

If everything worked you should get a zip file on the same level as the Feasibility_Code.Rproj file named "Results_(database name).zip".
Please upload this in the EHDEN teams in the folder "feasibility"/"uploads from data partners/"new results".

Thank you for running the feasibility step!
