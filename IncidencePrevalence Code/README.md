### Instructions
Please clone the entire repository into your R environment or pull the update into your existing repository.

You only need to interact with the file CodeToRun.R

## Issues

If you encounter any errors or if you have questions, please report them as an issue here in github. 
Other people may have the same questions, and thereby we can answer them for all. 

### Of Note
The package CDM Connector does not support the database management system BIG QUERY, Azure Synapse, i.e. it may not be possible for you to contribute results to the MegaStudy. 
It does support SQLServer, postgresql, redshift, snowflake, oracle, and spark. 
If you have another database management system we will find out how it goes. Please report this as an issue in github.

## There is no shiny available yet
Please let us know if you need a shiny to check your results before returning them to us.

## Returning results

If everything worked you should get a zip file on the same level as the IncidencePrevalence Code.Rproj file named "Results_(database name).zip"
Please upload this in the EHDEN teams in the folder "IncidencePrevalence"/"uploads from data partners/"new results".

Thank you for running the IncidencePrevalence code!
