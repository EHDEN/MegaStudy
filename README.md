## Feasibility Code

The folder "Feasibility Code" will provide you with the code you need to run the Feasibility step for the MegaStudy.


## Feasibility Shiny

The folder "Feasibility Shiny" will provide you with a Shiny code with which you can look at your results in case this if of interest to you before sharing the results with us.


## Returning results

If everything worked you should get a zip folder on the same level as the Feasibility_Code.Rproj file named "Results_(database name).zip".
Please upload this in the EHDEN teams in the folder "feasibility".
