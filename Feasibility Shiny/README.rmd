# Feasibility Shiny

This step is optional if you want to look at your results before sending them back to us. This code contains a shiny to view your results from the Feasibility Code (all but the "diagnosticsSummary")

## Instructions

You have already cloned the repository which means that this Shiny project is already part of your R environment.

However, the renv lock for the shiny is different from the renv for the Code. Therefore you have to run the following command in the console to install all R packages in the right version.

```{r}
renv::activate()
renv::restore()
```

Subsequently, please put your results folder (extracted from zip) into the "data" folder that you see in this R project.

Then open global.R and click "Run App" in the top right corner.
